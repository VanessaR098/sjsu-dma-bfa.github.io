      <div class="statement"> <i>DreamScape </i> focuses on the timeline where
          the 2020 Covid pandemic started in the United States. It was a beautiful day; I was
          halfway through my college education. I was doing good on my classes, exploring campus
          was always a refreshing experience after completing my assignments, and hanging out with
          friends was great because it would distract me from the stress I had with my studies. Then,
          everything changed rapidly when the Covid pandemic was officially announced. Classes were
          no longer in person, you had to quarantine in your room, and most social places and events
          were canceled or closed. It was the most weirdest, darkest, loneliest, bizarre experience
          that lasted two years. This room represents the insanity of staying the room and
          being in isolation due to quarantine.
