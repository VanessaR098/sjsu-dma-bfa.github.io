      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement"><i>Get to It</i> is a video project featuring original 2D animation and music. This is a short story that draws aspects from my personal experience as an artist. The character and setting, while fictional in portrayal, reflect feelings and adversities that are undoubtedly real to myself and possibly others in the same field. The dreaded Artist's Block plays a major role in this story as it often does in the lives of many artists new and old. <br> Although there are many times when I am bursting with ideas and motivation, that energy can often go mysteriously missing when I actually have the spare time to invest it. Observing my own lack of progress can be incredibly demoralizing and kick off a unhelpful chain reaction in my psyche. Inspired by the mythological roc, the celestial bird of prey is a culmination of many deep-rooted fears that stem from failing as an artist. <br>

Throughout my life and even now, video games are my oasis. They inspire, refresh, and feed my soul but at no small cost. Although I aspire to create video games as a career, they produce an intoxicating scent that pulls me away from creation and towards consumption. My unhealthy relationship with the oasis is an issue I must accept and address to open the path forward. <br>

Looking at my lot in life, there is no doubt that I am extraordinarily lucky to even have the option to pursue this sort of career path. It would only be fair to myself and those who support me that I properly apply myself regardless of my momentary circumstances.  </div>
