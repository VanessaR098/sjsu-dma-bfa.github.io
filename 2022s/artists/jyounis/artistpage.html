      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">Still Learning with Jas is a look behind the curtains of what is going on in my head. 
        The intent with Still Learning with Jas is to talk about exploration of identity. My identity ties in with being in the period of adolescence where I am in my last year of university and anticipating life after university. 
        I am also learning how to navigate talking about my identity of being a mixed woman of color. 
      Lastly, I’ve been learning about talking about my experiences with mental health and how to talk about mental health with the communities I am a part of. 
      Through the use of multiple mediums, from video projection, screen printing, traditional/digital illustration, and sound I will be introducing you to who I truly am.

     In this gallery exhibition specifically, I will only be showing you the work in progress, drafts, and the potential room for exploration. 
        Still Learning with Jas also represents the learning curve about claiming the artist title, navigating student life and career in the arts, but also discovering what art means to me and learning there is no one way to exhibit in a gallery. 
        I hope you enjoy the in progress work and I look forward to sharing more with you in other gallery settings.

      <div class="bioTitle">ARTIST BIO</div>
      <div class="bio">Jasmin Younis is a mixed media artist. 
        The mediums she works in ranges from analogue and digital illustration, screen printing, and video filming/editing. 
        With those mediums, Jasmin creates artwork that leads to conversations about navigating her identity about being a mixed woman of color, an Arab woman, an artist, and a twenty-something. 
        Her goal is to work in the live-action and animation industry to create works relating to how representation matters through production management. 
        Jasmin is expected to graduate in Spring ‘22 from San José State University with a BFA in Digital Media Art and a minor in Advertising.
