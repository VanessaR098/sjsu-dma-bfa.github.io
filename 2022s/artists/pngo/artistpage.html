      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">Overcooked is a series of 3D models that portray the struggles of being a daughter in a traditional Asian family. As a child of immigrant parents, I have always felt pressure to achieve what my parents anticipated. There are high expectations that Asian parents have for their daughters. We are expected to live up to Asian beauty standards that are defined by colorism and fatphobia. We must take care of those around us, but are seen as selfish when we care for ourselves. These draining standards take a huge toll on mental health. Overcooked depicts these feelings of frustration and burnout through images of food since food is such a powerful communicator. My family is not the type to show affection towards each other, but one of the ways we show our care is through providing meals. Because of this, I find myself cooking for the people I care about. This book is a collection of some of my favorite recipes. As you flip through these pages, you will learn more about the challenges of the women featured in Overcooked.</div>
      <div class="bioTitle">ARTIST BIO</div>
      <div class="bio">Patty Ngo is a digital media artist based out of the Bay Area. Her artwork creates a rush of dopamine using feel-good imagery with subtle references to pop culture.
      She uses her artwork as a form of activism, tackling topics such as environmental conservation, Asian American representation, and gender equality. She makes work with the intention of bringing attention to these heavy topics without leaving her audience feeling burdened with the harsh realities of the world. Patty believes that presenting subjects in a lighthearted way makes them easier to digest for some viewers. She works in both 2D and 3D workspaces to transport her audience into whimsical fantasy universes. Patty is currently a student of the Digital Media Arts program at San Jose State University, expected to graduate in Spring 2022.
