      <div class="statement">如夢似幻 - Dreamlike discusses the beauty in tradition as it showcases different Chinese mythological creatures as well as traditional Chinese clothing from the Han to Song Dynasty modeled by Tiktok influencer and hanfu
        expert, MochiHanfu.
        The pieces are modeled using Blender and NomadSculpt and the photos are edited using Lightroom Classic and Photoshop.
        Scroll drawings are also seen in the back of the room and they were created using Procreate.
        This work highlights the vast history and stories of Chinese heritage as throughout newer generations, stories and knowledge are slowly being forgotten.
        The exhibit is held in a room with traditional Moon Gates to display each of the five mythical creatures alongside their accompanying photo.
        The room also has audio to fully immerse the viewer in their experience.
        Additionally, hovering over different objects in the room explain their stories and cultural significance as well as historical facts dating back to their original time periods.
