      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">For the longest time, I have struggled to find my voice as an artist. For many years now, I have always created art that I thought would please others, instead of creating art for myself and finding others who would like it. Before, my art had no direction or meaning, but I have started creating work around the concepts of emotions, fantasy and have taken a strong interest in illustration and character design Art.Many of my art pieces are now created from the heart. An idea comes to me, and over the course of a few days, sometimes even a few hours it begins to manifest into something bigger. I’ve found that after I have stopped forcing myself to create things and instead create what comes naturally, I end up enjoying the process and feel incredibly inspired. 
 I discovered an artist by the name of Paola Pivi. I instantly became interested in her work because of her colorful neon bears installation art. As I researched more about her, she quickly became someone who was inspirational to me. Not only for the work she creates, but because of who she is as an artist and person. Paola Pivi is the polar opposite to who I was. I created work that tried to please everyone, while she created just to create. Her values really resonated with me and further inspired me to create artwork for myself.  
This is how the concept for my project “They Journey” was developed. I have always watched everyone around me find their place and voice in who they wanted to be, while I continued to struggle in finding my own voice and purpose. Everyone’s journey is different, but the end goal is more or less the same. The Journey is an online space that will be an explorable environment.  Hosted in New Art City, where previous BFA shows have been held. The viewer will be able to explore the space at their own pace.  It will start off as a dark area and as the viewer progresses they will be able to decide where they wish to go. There will be multiple paths that the viewer can take, but regardless of what path they take the end will ultimately be the same. Each room will have a unique environment with symbolic meaning to the objects placed there.
My goal with this project is to help the viewer visualize the feelings that come along with finding yourself. The darkness represents the feelings of uncertainty, fear, and the unknown. The road is long,  but no one will be able to predict how long until the end. There will also be other rooms that the viewer can go through. Some rooms will be peaceful, and invoke happy thoughts, while others will be a bit darker to give feelings of anxiety.
