      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">Gho$t World is an NFT series created by Digital Media Artist Cris Gutierrez. The concept behind this NFT collection is to reconcile with others on a trope that you may or may not have used in your lifetime. That saying in question is "going ghost", this might seem like a confusing phrase that might not make sense. But for some viewers out there this could be everything. At the times of our growth and elevation in life, there are often times when we do not want to be bombarded by others not that we are selfish but because we are focusing on our future. Many of us had to "go ghost" in our life where we escape from the stress of the world in order to realign our lives and care solely for ourselves. This collection is meant to reassure and connect with those who feel they have needed to step back in the dark in order to shine. A validation that you are not a selfish person for wanting to care about yourself and your future.</div>
