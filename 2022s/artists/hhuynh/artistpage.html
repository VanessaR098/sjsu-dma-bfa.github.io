      <div class="statement">
As contemporary life is continuously molded by technology, our perspective on ourselves, humanity, and ultimately the world has fundamentally changed. Examining these realities of living today — uniquely defined by and mediated through technology — MINDMAPPING embodies the artistic spirit in the convention of New Media Art as it visualizes the complex, creative dynamic between man and machine.
<br><br>
In conversation of the ideas of authorship, auteurship, and the muse, the compositions of MINDMAPPING are composed by no person; images and texts are created by artificial intelligence (AI) as the appropriation of various texts and images from a panoply of sources and inspirations form new compositions. Technology defines the perspective of the project, much like how it has our epoch. As code, text, and images that supplement these neural networks rely on human vision and hand, the creative process becomes an exposition of the complex dialogue between man and machine — as such a collaboration.  
<br><br>
As such, imagery is depicted in a splendor, paralleling traditions of painting and visions of the natural world — from a floral richness to the organic lines of nature’s architecture. From these visualizations emerges a subtle harmony that reflects our modern reality characterized by technology and the natural world sharing an accordance with humanity. Textual compositions are poetry complementary to each graphical work. In effect, they begin to converse. A subversion of traditional artist statements and descriptions, AI transgresses limitations to engage with the viewer. Harmonious yet contrasting, each pair of graphic and textual works engage in dialogue with each other, and the viewer. Through image — underscored with notions of the sensorial and emotional — eschews intellectual discourse, in favor of an emotional, visceral spontaneity. Text grounds and rationalizes the expression of the spirit found in its complementary image. 
<br><br>
Like a map of the mind, every composition is a manifestation of windows that peer into an elaborate thought process — a complex, impossible network of dialogues that embodies the relationship between man and machine.
        <h3>SHOW SPACE </h3>
To further underscore technology's influence and role in the project, these artworks are exhibited and engage with viewers through a digital landscape. A crossbreed between gallery, ancient basilicas, and warehouse environments, the exhibition interior is imagined as a colossal chamber, constructed with a brutalist sobriety that reflects past and present architectural design codes.
<br><br>
The language and mood of the space fuses tradition with a science-fiction nostalgia. Grand concrete pillars populate the chamber as they connect panels that display the artworks. Delineating the space's industrial precision are long lines of neon lights that operate functionally and aesthetically; they become guides for the viewer's navigation through the exhibition space while simultaneously generating a radiant enfilade — outlining the space's complex, rigid geometry.
<br><br>
The space is punctuated with deliberate and meticulous deterioration and distressing; happenstance is pretense to extreme precision. Simulating ultimately suspends and predicts a moment of the space’s passage of time – an amplification of actuality and temporality that propounds an allure in the senescence of architecture. Like an ancient basilica, the space becomes a palace of AI, of technology as rawness and roughness paradoxically highlights the delicacy of each oeuvre.
<br><br>
Such a space freely imagined develops a dreamlike atmosphere. The result is moments of heightened aesthetic emotion that echo the ethos of a physical gallery as much as it proposes new possibilities for the exhibition experience.

        <h3>PRESENTATION</h3>
Art is constantly presented in spaces that elevate its meaning. Here, these compositions are invigorated through cutting-edge 21st-century technology. MINDMAPPING is exhibited through a show space rendered by Unreal Engine 5, the latest iteration of Epic Games’ flagship game engine most recently utilized for The Matrix Awakens — an immersive gaming experience composed of high quality, photorealistic environments. Unreal — like art — is transportive, creating environments, forging new realities.

      <div class="bioTitle">ARTIST BIO</div>
      <div class="bio">From an innate curiosity that led to an affinity towards technology — HNYH cultivates his interests and inspirations through the creation of artworks that explore a wider convention of contemporary culture and aesthetics. From Adobe Photoshop to SideFX’s Houdini, HNYH engages in a panoply of digital applications that further his artistic vision. 
 <br><br>
In his work, he translates the physical quotidian into a digital environment in which he explores human gestures, tactility and dimension, and contemporary aesthetics as technology has been at a crossroads with the real world. 
 <br><br>
Understanding how technology has become a crucial element in drawing people in intimacies — communicating indifferent of physical limitations through the power of the internet — HNYH has recently honed on and engages with the web environment as a tool to exhibit and create his art. Burgeoning innovations such as pixel streaming and WebGPU are recent forays into further expanding his artistry.
 <br><br>
Despite a profound passion towards digital art, HNYH hopes to engage in future works that harmoniously combine physical and digital mediums. Potentially drawing out the best qualities of them, he hopes to explore a different perspective to the art experience, one that builds a rapport with the audience and technology.
