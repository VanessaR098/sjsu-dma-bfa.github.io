      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">“Belong” is a piece that uses the abstraction of shapes and colors as a metaphor. Though it is an abstraction that is appealing to the eye, there is also a story that may not be so obvious to some. Throughout the story, the main focus is a certain red circle. As this red circle journeys through a purple world, it finds out about some of the unpleasant truths about reality, including that of discrimination and prejudice. The piece uses colors and extravagant shapes and movement as a way to distract the audience, showing how oftentimes, like in our reality, the crimes against humanity often go unnoticed or are not taken seriously. <br />
Each of the over 1000 frames in the animation is hand-drawn by myself in Adobe Animate and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro. The animation was adapted from a storyboard which I also created. The process of this conversion can be seen partly through the trailer, which can be viewed here.
