      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">Non Unsustainable, or just sustainable, is the name of the project I created for both the virtual and physical galleries made by the graduating Digital Media Art class of 2022. Non Unsustainable is a mock up skateboard company that takes the classic skateboard products and makes them environmentally green. Taking the traditional maple skateboard decks and making them out of bamboo, classic cotton t-shirts made out of bamboo fibers, everything that can possibly change these “OG” products and make them better for the environment but still rival in every other aspect.
<br><br>
All of the artwork that was created, and eventually printed on shirts or skateboards, was all created with one idea, the earth we live on. The eight logos feature views of a variety of landscapes found all over this planet in unique shapes and colors for each landscape view. The logos were created in a way so that the printing process was not extensive; all of them are one color prints. This minimized having to print multiple times for one shirt, however for the black shirts, there is a need to printed either twice or print a “priming layer” of white ink so that the color really pops off the black shirt. The physical skateboard created was an image collage of the eight logos that I created to make up the entire board, however, there were a variety of other board mock ups on the website I created. I wanted to create a website that hosted the mock ups and other pieces that I couldn’t necessarily get done for the physical gallery, but also something that looks like a professional website that a skateboard company would host their e-commerce through.
<br><br>
I hope to voice the cons of traditional forms of skateboard decks and accessories for the environment and showcase the pros of green materials like bamboo. I also hope to showcase the ability to create a brand from the bottom up; from anything like the original company logo to the entire brand identity. In the near future, I hope to have a website like this hosted and able to take orders in hopes of growing the voice for what this project stands for, as well as my own artistic voice. Please enjoy the work.

      <div class="bioTitle">ARTIST BIO</div>
      <div class="bio">	Through digital illustration, my practice explores the gap between the physical and digital worlds while talking about issues like mental health and global warming. These digital illustrations are created primarily in Adobe Illustrator, however, my knowledge of the Adobe Suite and other software allows for my artistic practice to have other forms of creation. A majority of my work features some low poly illustration to recreate the physical form that I am focused on. This low poly illustration utilizes purely triangles to create an image, almost like triangular pixels that vary in size, and has been used in previous projects in more than just the literal way of creating art to talk about an issue. The number of triangles in an image can also have meaning and a message.
	<br><br>
  The conversation about mental health while using this style I think is very current as a lot of our mental health issues today stem from social media or digital entities. It’s again this relationship between the digital and physical that my work explores by creating a digital illustration that talks about the effects of digital platforms or entities on the physical, or what we call people. My style has evolved from my love for skateboard culture and its art by using those colors and some styles, but also always making sure the piece still shows me through it. I hope that these illustrations spark emotions or get people thinking about the mindset behind each piece.
