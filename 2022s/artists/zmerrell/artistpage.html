      <div class="statementTitle">ARTIST STATEMENT</div>
      <div class="statement">Non Unsustainable, or just sustainable, is the name of the project I created for both the virtual and physical galleries made by the graduating Digital Media Art class of 2022. Non Unsustainable is a mock up skateboard company that takes the classic skateboard products and makes them environmentally green. Taking the traditional maple skateboard decks and making them out of bamboo, classic cotton t-shirts made out of bamboo fibers, everything that can possibly change these “OG” products and make them better for the environment but still rival in every other aspect.
<br><br>
I hope to voice the cons of traditional forms of skateboard decks and accessories for the environment and showcase the pros of green materials like bamboo. I also hope to showcase the ability to create a brand from the bottom up; from anything like the original company logo to the entire brand identity. In the near future, I hope to have a website like this hosted and able to take orders in hopes of growing the voice for what this project stands for, as well as my own artistic voice. Please enjoy the work.

      <div class="bioTitle">ARTIST BIO</div>
      <div class="bio">	Zack Merrell was born in San Jose, California, in 1999. Growing up in Santa Cruz, only a short drive over California's Highway 17, he fell in love with art due to the environment that he grew up in. His passion for the art on the bottom of skateboard decks drove him into his art tenure. 
<br><br>
	      While taking art classes in high school, Zack found his love for digital illustrations which goes hand and hand with the art of the skateboard community. Moving back to his birthplace of San Jose, California in late 2017 to pursue a bachelor's in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University, he broadened his abilities to mediums like screen printing, photography, and design.
